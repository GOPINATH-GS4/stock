    summary: 'Up to 50% of medication errors and 20% of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the hospital\n      setting are estimated to be related to communication issues regarding patient medications at\n      various transition points of care from admission to discharge.  The Joint Commission (TJC)\n      requires accurate and complete medication reconciliation occur at each transition point\n      throughout hospitalization.  Evidence from NQF demonstrates pharmacists (RPh) are the most\n      effective medication management team leaders in the implementation of medication management\n      practices and design of medication error reduction strategies; medication reconciliation is\n      one of the five safety objectives pharmacists are recommended to lead.  In addition, the\n      Massachusetts Coalition for the Prevention of Medical Errors states strong evidence supports\n      the use of pharmacy technicians (CPhT) in conjunction with pharmacists in completing\n      accurate medication histories.\n\n      WMC nurses (RN) currently are involved in the medication reconciliation process.  In 2009, a\n      Medication Use Evaluation (MUE) of Medication Reconciliation Accuracy found a 67% medication\n      error rate on admission determined by comparing the nurse-obtained medication history to the\n      pharmacist-obtained medication history.  The number of home medications identified by the\n      pharmacist compared to the nurse was 411 versus 312 (p<0.0001).

    summary: 'Background Type 1 diabetes is characterized by pancreatic beta-cell destruction and an\n      inability to synthesize insulin.  Connecting peptide (C-peptide) is formed from the same\n      precursor as insulin and is produced in equimolar amounts as insulin.  There are several\n      clinical trials currently being performed to explore the possibility of beta-cell\n      preservation or regeneration.  Most children are not eligible for these trials because it is\n      often presumed that C-peptide levels will decrease and become undetectable after years of\n      having type 1 diabetes.  Several studies in the adult population have demonstrated that\n      C-peptide may remain measureable in patients who have had diabetes for up to 50 years after\n      diagnosis.  Recently, it was demonstrated that 10% of adult patients who have had type 1\n      diabetes for 31-40 years have measureable levels of serum C-peptide if measured with an\n      ultrasensitive assay.  The levels were lower in patients who had diabetes for a longer time.\n       This pattern was also demonstrated in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)\n      and NHANES trial.  No studies have been performed exclusively in pediatric patients\n      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that C-peptide should be detectable in the sera of\n      pediatric patients who have had type 1 diabetes for greater than 1 year and as far out as >\n      20 years after diagnosis.  The investigators also hypothesize that since their patient\n      population has had diabetes for less time as compared to adults, the levels of C-peptide\n      should be higher than reported for adults and that a greater proportion of patients in the\n      pediatric population will have detectable C-peptide levels as compared to adults.',

The Joint Commission (TJC)\n      requires accurate and complete medication reconciliation occur at each transition point\n      throughout hospitalization.  Evidence from NQF demonstrates pharmacists (RPh) are the most\n      effective medication management team leaders in the implementation of medication management\n      practices and design of medication error reduction strategies; medication reconciliation is\n      one of the five safety objectives pharmacists are recommended to lead.  In addition, the\n      Massachusetts Coalition for the Prevention of Medical Errors states strong evidence supports\n      the use of pharmacy technicians (CPhT) in conjunction with pharmacists in completing\n      accurate medication histories.\n\n      WMC nurses (RN) currently are involved in the medication reconciliation process.  In 2009, a\n      Medication Use Evaluation (MUE) of Medication Reconciliation Accuracy found a 67% medication\n      error rate on admission determined by comparing the nurse-obtained medication history to the\n      pharmacist-obtained medication history.

Connecting peptide (C-peptide) is formed from the same\n      precursor as insulin and is produced in equimolar amounts as insulin.  There are several\n      clinical trials currently being performed to explore the possibility of beta-cell\n      preservation or regeneration.  Most children are not eligible for these trials because it is\n      often presumed that C-peptide levels will decrease and become undetectable after years of\n      having type 1 diabetes.  Several studies in the adult population have demonstrated that\n      C-peptide may remain measureable in patients who have had diabetes for up to 50 years after\n      diagnosis.  Recently, it was demonstrated that 10% of adult patients who have had type 1\n      diabetes for 31-40 years have measureable levels of serum C-peptide if measured with an\n      ultrasensitive assay.  The levels were lower in patients who had diabetes for a longer time.\n       This pattern was also demonstrated in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)\n      and NHANES trial.  No studies have been performed exclusively in pediatric patients\n      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that C-peptide should be detectable in the sera of\n      pediatric patients who have had type 1 diabetes for greater than 1 year and as far out as >\n      20 years after diagnosis.  The investigators also hypothesize that since their patient\n      population has had diabetes for less time as compared to adults, the levels of C-peptide\n      should be higher than reported for adults and that a greater proportion of patients in the\n      pediatric population will have detectable C-peptide levels as compared to adults.',

Connecting peptide (C-peptide) is formed from the same\n      precursor as insulin and is produced in equimolar amounts as insulin.  There are several\n      clinical trials currently being performed to explore the possibility of beta-cell\n      preservation or regeneration.  Most children are not eligible for these trials because it is\n      often presumed that C-peptide levels will decrease and become undetectable after years of\n      having type 1 diabetes.  Several studies in the adult population have demonstrated that\n      C-peptide may remain measureable in patients who have had diabetes for up to 50 years after\n      diagnosis.  Recently, it was demonstrated that 10% of adult patients who have had type 1\n      diabetes for 31-40 years have measureable levels of serum C-peptide if measured with an\n      ultrasensitive assay.  The levels were lower in patients who had diabetes for a longer time.\n       This pattern was also demonstrated in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)\n      and NHANES trial.  No studies have been performed exclusively in pediatric patients\n      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that C-peptide should be detectable in the sera of\n      pediatric patients who have had type 1 diabetes for greater than 1 year and as far out as >\n      20 years after diagnosis.  The investigators also hypothesize that since their patient\n      population has had diabetes for less time as compared to adults, the levels of C-peptide\n      should be higher than reported for adults and that a greater proportion of patients in the\n      pediatric population will have detectable C-peptide levels as compared to adults.',

    summary: 'Background Type 1 diabetes is characterized by pancreatic beta-cell destruction and an\n      inability to synthesize insulin.  Connecting peptide (C-peptide) is formed from the same\n      precursor as insulin and is produced in equimolar amounts as insulin.  There are several\n      clinical trials currently being performed to explore the possibility of beta-cell\n      preservation or regeneration.  Most children are not eligible for these trials because it is\n      often presumed that C-peptide levels will decrease and become undetectable after years of\n      having type 1 diabetes.  Several studies in the adult population have demonstrated that\n      C-peptide may remain measureable in patients who have had diabetes for up to 50 years after\n      diagnosis.  Recently, it was demonstrated that 10% of adult patients who have had type 1\n      diabetes for 31-40 years have measureable levels of serum C-peptide if measured with an\n      ultrasensitive assay.  The levels were lower in patients who had diabetes for a longer time.\n       This pattern was also demonstrated in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)\n      and NHANES trial.  No studies have been performed exclusively in pediatric patients\n      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that C-peptide should be detectable in the sera of\n      pediatric patients who have had type 1 diabetes for greater than 1 year and as far out as >\n      20 years after diagnosis.  The investigators also hypothesize that since their patient\n      population has had diabetes for less time as compared to adults, the levels of C-peptide\n      should be higher than reported for adults and that a greater proportion of patients in the\n      pediatric population will have detectable C-peptide levels as compared to adults.',

Connecting peptide (C-peptide) is formed from the same\n      precursor as insulin and is produced in equimolar amounts as insulin.  There are several\n      clinical trials currently being performed to explore the possibility of beta-cell\n      preservation or regeneration.  Most children are not eligible for these trials because it is\n      often presumed that C-peptide levels will decrease and become undetectable after years of\n      having type 1 diabetes.  Several studies in the adult population have demonstrated that\n      C-peptide may remain measureable in patients who have had diabetes for up to 50 years after\n      diagnosis.  Recently, it was demonstrated that 10% of adult patients who have had type 1\n      diabetes for 31-40 years have measureable levels of serum C-peptide if measured with an\n      ultrasensitive assay.  The levels were lower in patients who had diabetes for a longer time.\n       This pattern was also demonstrated in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)\n      and NHANES trial.  No studies have been performed exclusively in pediatric patients\n      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that C-peptide should be detectable in the sera of\n      pediatric patients who have had type 1 diabetes for greater than 1 year and as far out as >\n      20 years after diagnosis.  The investigators also hypothesize that since their patient\n      population has had diabetes for less time as compared to adults, the levels of C-peptide\n      should be higher than reported for adults and that a greater proportion of patients in the\n      pediatric population will have detectable C-peptide levels as compared to adults.',

Connecting peptide (C-peptide) is formed from the same\n      precursor as insulin and is produced in equimolar amounts as insulin.  There are several\n      clinical trials currently being performed to explore the possibility of beta-cell\n      preservation or regeneration.  Most children are not eligible for these trials because it is\n      often presumed that C-peptide levels will decrease and become undetectable after years of\n      having type 1 diabetes.  Several studies in the adult population have demonstrated that\n      C-peptide may remain measureable in patients who have had diabetes for up to 50 years after\n      diagnosis.  Recently, it was demonstrated that 10% of adult patients who have had type 1\n      diabetes for 31-40 years have measureable levels of serum C-peptide if measured with an\n      ultrasensitive assay.  The levels were lower in patients who had diabetes for a longer time.\n       This pattern was also demonstrated in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)\n      and NHANES trial.  No studies have been performed exclusively in pediatric patients\n      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that C-peptide should be detectable in the sera of\n      pediatric patients who have had type 1 diabetes for greater than 1 year and as far out as >\n      20 years after diagnosis.  The investigators also hypothesize that since their patient\n      population has had diabetes for less time as compared to adults, the levels of C-peptide\n      should be higher than reported for adults and that a greater proportion of patients in the\n      pediatric population will have detectable C-peptide levels as compared to adults.',

The Joint Commission (TJC)\n      requires accurate and complete medication reconciliation occur at each transition point\n      throughout hospitalization.  Evidence from NQF demonstrates pharmacists (RPh) are the most\n      effective medication management team leaders in the implementation of medication management\n      practices and design of medication error reduction strategies; medication reconciliation is\n      one of the five safety objectives pharmacists are recommended to lead.  In addition, the\n      Massachusetts Coalition for the Prevention of Medical Errors states strong evidence supports\n      the use of pharmacy technicians (CPhT) in conjunction with pharmacists in completing\n      accurate medication histories.\n\n      WMC nurses (RN) currently are involved in the medication reconciliation process.  In 2009, a\n      Medication Use Evaluation (MUE) of Medication Reconciliation Accuracy found a 67% medication\n      error rate on admission determined by comparing the nurse-obtained medication history to the\n      pharmacist-obtained medication history.

Connecting peptide (C-peptide) is formed from the same\n      precursor as insulin and is produced in equimolar amounts as insulin.  There are several\n      clinical trials currently being performed to explore the possibility of beta-cell\n      preservation or regeneration.  Most children are not eligible for these trials because it is\n      often presumed that C-peptide levels will decrease and become undetectable after years of\n      having type 1 diabetes.  Several studies in the adult population have demonstrated that\n      C-peptide may remain measureable in patients who have had diabetes for up to 50 years after\n      diagnosis.  Recently, it was demonstrated that 10% of adult patients who have had type 1\n      diabetes for 31-40 years have measureable levels of serum C-peptide if measured with an\n      ultrasensitive assay.  The levels were lower in patients who had diabetes for a longer time.\n       This pattern was also demonstrated in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)\n      and NHANES trial.  No studies have been performed exclusively in pediatric patients\n      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that C-peptide should be detectable in the sera of\n      pediatric patients who have had type 1 diabetes for greater than 1 year and as far out as >\n      20 years after diagnosis.  The investigators also hypothesize that since their patient\n      population has had diabetes for less time as compared to adults, the levels of C-peptide\n      should be higher than reported for adults and that a greater proportion of patients in the\n      pediatric population will have detectable C-peptide levels as compared to adults.',

    summary: 'Up to 50% of medication errors and 20% of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the hospital\n      setting are estimated to be related to communication issues regarding patient medications at\n      various transition points of care from admission to discharge.  The Joint Commission (TJC)\n      requires accurate and complete medication reconciliation occur at each transition point\n      throughout hospitalization.  Evidence from NQF demonstrates pharmacists (RPh) are the most\n      effective medication management team leaders in the implementation of medication management\n      practices and design of medication error reduction strategies; medication reconciliation is\n      one of the five safety objectives pharmacists are recommended to lead.  In addition, the\n      Massachusetts Coalition for the Prevention of Medical Errors states strong evidence supports\n      the use of pharmacy technicians (CPhT) in conjunction with pharmacists in completing\n      accurate medication histories.\n\n      WMC nurses (RN) currently are involved in the medication reconciliation process.  In 2009, a\n      Medication Use Evaluation (MUE) of Medication Reconciliation Accuracy found a 67% medication\n      error rate on admission determined by comparing the nurse-obtained medication history to the\n      pharmacist-obtained medication history.  The number of home medications identified by the\n      pharmacist compared to the nurse was 411 versus 312 (p<0.0001).  The total percentage of\n      medication errors prevented by the pharmacist was 66.2.  Using the VA Healthcare Failure\n      Mode Effects Analysis - HFMEA™ Hazard Scoring Matrix, 3 independent pharmacist reviewers\n      found that 18% of patients interviewed had a score greater than 7, and 3 patients had a\n      score of 12 (major/probable), if the discrepancies would not have been identified and\n      corrected by the pharmacist conducting the admission medication reconciliation audit.

    summary: 'Background Type 1 diabetes is characterized by pancreatic beta-cell destruction and an\n      inability to synthesize insulin.  Connecting peptide (C-peptide) is formed from the same\n      precursor as insulin and is produced in equimolar amounts as insulin.  There are several\n      clinical trials currently being performed to explore the possibility of beta-cell\n      preservation or regeneration.  Most children are not eligible for these trials because it is\n      often presumed that C-peptide levels will decrease and become undetectable after years of\n      having type 1 diabetes.  Several studies in the adult population have demonstrated that\n      C-peptide may remain measureable in patients who have had diabetes for up to 50 years after\n      diagnosis.  Recently, it was demonstrated that 10% of adult patients who have had type 1\n      diabetes for 31-40 years have measureable levels of serum C-peptide if measured with an\n      ultrasensitive assay.  The levels were lower in patients who had diabetes for a longer time.\n       This pattern was also demonstrated in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)\n      and NHANES trial.  No studies have been performed exclusively in pediatric patients\n      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that C-peptide should be detectable in the sera of\n      pediatric patients who have had type 1 diabetes for greater than 1 year and as far out as >\n      20 years after diagnosis.  The investigators also hypothesize that since their patient\n      population has had diabetes for less time as compared to adults, the levels of C-peptide\n      should be higher than reported for adults and that a greater proportion of patients in the\n      pediatric population will have detectable C-peptide levels as compared to adults.',

The Joint Commission (TJC)\n      requires accurate and complete medication reconciliation occur at each transition point\n      throughout hospitalization.  Evidence from NQF demonstrates pharmacists (RPh) are the most\n      effective medication management team leaders in the implementation of medication management\n      practices and design of medication error reduction strategies; medication reconciliation is\n      one of the five safety objectives pharmacists are recommended to lead.  In addition, the\n      Massachusetts Coalition for the Prevention of Medical Errors states strong evidence supports\n      the use of pharmacy technicians (CPhT) in conjunction with pharmacists in completing\n      accurate medication histories.\n\n      WMC nurses (RN) currently are involved in the medication reconciliation process.  In 2009, a\n      Medication Use Evaluation (MUE) of Medication Reconciliation Accuracy found a 67% medication\n      error rate on admission determined by comparing the nurse-obtained medication history to the\n      pharmacist-obtained medication history.  The number of home medications identified by the\n      pharmacist compared to the nurse was 411 versus 312 (p<0.0001).  The total percentage of\n      medication errors prevented by the pharmacist was 66.2.

    summary: 'Background Type 1 diabetes is characterized by pancreatic beta-cell destruction and an\n      inability to synthesize insulin.  Connecting peptide (C-peptide) is formed from the same\n      precursor as insulin and is produced in equimolar amounts as insulin.  There are several\n      clinical trials currently being performed to explore the possibility of beta-cell\n      preservation or regeneration.  Most children are not eligible for these trials because it is\n      often presumed that C-peptide levels will decrease and become undetectable after years of\n      having type 1 diabetes.  Several studies in the adult population have demonstrated that\n      C-peptide may remain measureable in patients who have had diabetes for up to 50 years after\n      diagnosis.  Recently, it was demonstrated that 10% of adult patients who have had type 1\n      diabetes for 31-40 years have measureable levels of serum C-peptide if measured with an\n      ultrasensitive assay.  The levels were lower in patients who had diabetes for a longer time.\n       This pattern was also demonstrated in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)\n      and NHANES trial.  No studies have been performed exclusively in pediatric patients\n      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that C-peptide should be detectable in the sera of\n      pediatric patients who have had type 1 diabetes for greater than 1 year and as far out as >\n      20 years after diagnosis.  The investigators also hypothesize that since their patient\n      population has had diabetes for less time as compared to adults, the levels of C-peptide\n      should be higher than reported for adults and that a greater proportion of patients in the\n      pediatric population will have detectable C-peptide levels as compared to adults.',

    summary: 'Background Type 1 diabetes is characterized by pancreatic beta-cell destruction and an\n      inability to synthesize insulin.  Connecting peptide (C-peptide) is formed from the same\n      precursor as insulin and is produced in equimolar amounts as insulin.  There are several\n      clinical trials currently being performed to explore the possibility of beta-cell\n      preservation or regeneration.  Most children are not eligible for these trials because it is\n      often presumed that C-peptide levels will decrease and become undetectable after years of\n      having type 1 diabetes.  Several studies in the adult population have demonstrated that\n      C-peptide may remain measureable in patients who have had diabetes for up to 50 years after\n      diagnosis.  Recently, it was demonstrated that 10% of adult patients who have had type 1\n      diabetes for 31-40 years have measureable levels of serum C-peptide if measured with an\n      ultrasensitive assay.  The levels were lower in patients who had diabetes for a longer time.\n       This pattern was also demonstrated in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)\n      and NHANES trial.  No studies have been performed exclusively in pediatric patients\n      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that C-peptide should be detectable in the sera of\n      pediatric patients who have had type 1 diabetes for greater than 1 year and as far out as >\n      20 years after diagnosis.  The investigators also hypothesize that since their patient\n      population has had diabetes for less time as compared to adults, the levels of C-peptide\n      should be higher than reported for adults and that a greater proportion of patients in the\n      pediatric population will have detectable C-peptide levels as compared to adults.',

    summary: 'Background Type 1 diabetes is characterized by pancreatic beta-cell destruction and an\n      inability to synthesize insulin.  Connecting peptide (C-peptide) is formed from the same\n      precursor as insulin and is produced in equimolar amounts as insulin.  There are several\n      clinical trials currently being performed to explore the possibility of beta-cell\n      preservation or regeneration.  Most children are not eligible for these trials because it is\n      often presumed that C-peptide levels will decrease and become undetectable after years of\n      having type 1 diabetes.  Several studies in the adult population have demonstrated that\n      C-peptide may remain measureable in patients who have had diabetes for up to 50 years after\n      diagnosis.  Recently, it was demonstrated that 10% of adult patients who have had type 1\n      diabetes for 31-40 years have measureable levels of serum C-peptide if measured with an\n      ultrasensitive assay.  The levels were lower in patients who had diabetes for a longer time.\n       This pattern was also demonstrated in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)\n      and NHANES trial.  No studies have been performed exclusively in pediatric patients\n      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that C-peptide should be detectable in the sera of\n      pediatric patients who have had type 1 diabetes for greater than 1 year and as far out as >\n      20 years after diagnosis.  The investigators also hypothesize that since their patient\n      population has had diabetes for less time as compared to adults, the levels of C-peptide\n      should be higher than reported for adults and that a greater proportion of patients in the\n      pediatric population will have detectable C-peptide levels as compared to adults.',

Evidence from NQF demonstrates pharmacists (RPh) are the most\n      effective medication management team leaders in the implementation of medication management\n      practices and design of medication error reduction strategies; medication reconciliation is\n      one of the five safety objectives pharmacists are recommended to lead.  In addition, the\n      Massachusetts Coalition for the Prevention of Medical Errors states strong evidence supports\n      the use of pharmacy technicians (CPhT) in conjunction with pharmacists in completing\n      accurate medication histories.\n\n      WMC nurses (RN) currently are involved in the medication reconciliation process.  In 2009, a\n      Medication Use Evaluation (MUE) of Medication Reconciliation Accuracy found a 67% medication\n      error rate on admission determined by comparing the nurse-obtained medication history to the\n      pharmacist-obtained medication history.  The number of home medications identified by the\n      pharmacist compared to the nurse was 411 versus 312 (p<0.0001).  The total percentage of\n      medication errors prevented by the pharmacist was 66.2.

Others find cancer cells\n      and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Chemotherapy drugs such as\n      methotrexate, carboplatin, and cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of\n      cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Chemoprotective\n      drugs, such as sodium thiosulfate, may protect normal cells from the side effects of\n      chemotherapy. Osmotic blood-brain barrier disruption uses mannitol, to open tight junctions\n      in the blood vessels in the brain and allow methotrexate and carboplatin to be carried to\n      tumor. Giving rituximab together with blood-brain barrier disruption and methotrexate-based\n      chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of carboplatin\n      when given together with rituximab and methotrexate with blood-brain barrier disruption and\n      delayed  sodium thiosulfate chemoprotection to see how well they work in treating patients\n      with newly diagnosed primary central nervous system lymphoma.',

    summary: 'Up to 50% of medication errors and 20% of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the hospital\n      setting are estimated to be related to communication issues regarding patient medications at\n      various transition points of care from admission to discharge.  The Joint Commission (TJC)\n      requires accurate and complete medication reconciliation occur at each transition point\n      throughout hospitalization.  Evidence from NQF demonstrates pharmacists (RPh) are the most\n      effective medication management team leaders in the implementation of medication management\n      practices and design of medication error reduction strategies; medication reconciliation is\n      one of the five safety objectives pharmacists are recommended to lead.  In addition, the\n      Massachusetts Coalition for the Prevention of Medical Errors states strong evidence supports\n      the use of pharmacy technicians (CPhT) in conjunction with pharmacists in completing\n      accurate medication histories.\n\n      WMC nurses (RN) currently are involved in the medication reconciliation process.  In 2009, a\n      Medication Use Evaluation (MUE) of Medication Reconciliation Accuracy found a 67% medication\n      error rate on admission determined by comparing the nurse-obtained medication history to the\n      pharmacist-obtained medication history.  The number of home medications identified by the\n      pharmacist compared to the nurse was 411 versus 312 (p<0.0001).  The total percentage of\n      medication errors prevented by the pharmacist was 66.2.  Using the VA Healthcare Failure\n      Mode Effects Analysis - HFMEA™ Hazard Scoring Matrix, 3 independent pharmacist reviewers\n      found that 18% of patients interviewed had a score greater than 7, and 3 patients had a\n      score of 12 (major/probable), if the discrepancies would not have been identified and\n      corrected by the pharmacist conducting the admission medication reconciliation audit.  The\n      same patients\' discharge medication reconciliation and discharge medication lists were\n      retrospectively reviewed for the MUE, and the total percentage of patients with medication\n      errors on discharge was 43%.',

    summary: 'Background Type 1 diabetes is characterized by pancreatic beta-cell destruction and an\n      inability to synthesize insulin.  Connecting peptide (C-peptide) is formed from the same\n      precursor as insulin and is produced in equimolar amounts as insulin.  There are several\n      clinical trials currently being performed to explore the possibility of beta-cell\n      preservation or regeneration.  Most children are not eligible for these trials because it is\n      often presumed that C-peptide levels will decrease and become undetectable after years of\n      having type 1 diabetes.  Several studies in the adult population have demonstrated that\n      C-peptide may remain measureable in patients who have had diabetes for up to 50 years after\n      diagnosis.  Recently, it was demonstrated that 10% of adult patients who have had type 1\n      diabetes for 31-40 years have measureable levels of serum C-peptide if measured with an\n      ultrasensitive assay.  The levels were lower in patients who had diabetes for a longer time.\n       This pattern was also demonstrated in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)\n      and NHANES trial.  No studies have been performed exclusively in pediatric patients\n      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that C-peptide should be detectable in the sera of\n      pediatric patients who have had type 1 diabetes for greater than 1 year and as far out as >\n      20 years after diagnosis.  The investigators also hypothesize that since their patient\n      population has had diabetes for less time as compared to adults, the levels of C-peptide\n      should be higher than reported for adults and that a greater proportion of patients in the\n      pediatric population will have detectable C-peptide levels as compared to adults.',

    summary: 'Up to 50% of medication errors and 20% of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the hospital\n      setting are estimated to be related to communication issues regarding patient medications at\n      various transition points of care from admission to discharge.  The Joint Commission (TJC)\n      requires accurate and complete medication reconciliation occur at each transition point\n      throughout hospitalization.  Evidence from NQF demonstrates pharmacists (RPh) are the most\n      effective medication management team leaders in the implementation of medication management\n      practices and design of medication error reduction strategies; medication reconciliation is\n      one of the five safety objectives pharmacists are recommended to lead.  In addition, the\n      Massachusetts Coalition for the Prevention of Medical Errors states strong evidence supports\n      the use of pharmacy technicians (CPhT) in conjunction with pharmacists in completing\n      accurate medication histories.\n\n      WMC nurses (RN) currently are involved in the medication reconciliation process.  In 2009, a\n      Medication Use Evaluation (MUE) of Medication Reconciliation Accuracy found a 67% medication\n      error rate on admission determined by comparing the nurse-obtained medication history to the\n      pharmacist-obtained medication history.  The number of home medications identified by the\n      pharmacist compared to the nurse was 411 versus 312 (p<0.0001).  The total percentage of\n      medication errors prevented by the pharmacist was 66.2.  Using the VA Healthcare Failure\n      Mode Effects Analysis - HFMEA™ Hazard Scoring Matrix, 3 independent pharmacist reviewers\n      found that 18% of patients interviewed had a score greater than 7, and 3 patients had a\n      score of 12 (major/probable), if the discrepancies would not have been identified and\n      corrected by the pharmacist conducting the admission medication reconciliation audit.

    summary: 'Background Type 1 diabetes is characterized by pancreatic beta-cell destruction and an\n      inability to synthesize insulin.  Connecting peptide (C-peptide) is formed from the same\n      precursor as insulin and is produced in equimolar amounts as insulin.  There are several\n      clinical trials currently being performed to explore the possibility of beta-cell\n      preservation or regeneration.  Most children are not eligible for these trials because it is\n      often presumed that C-peptide levels will decrease and become undetectable after years of\n      having type 1 diabetes.  Several studies in the adult population have demonstrated that\n      C-peptide may remain measureable in patients who have had diabetes for up to 50 years after\n      diagnosis.  Recently, it was demonstrated that 10% of adult patients who have had type 1\n      diabetes for 31-40 years have measureable levels of serum C-peptide if measured with an\n      ultrasensitive assay.  The levels were lower in patients who had diabetes for a longer time.\n       This pattern was also demonstrated in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)\n      and NHANES trial.  No studies have been performed exclusively in pediatric patients\n      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that C-peptide should be detectable in the sera of\n      pediatric patients who have had type 1 diabetes for greater than 1 year and as far out as >\n      20 years after diagnosis.  The investigators also hypothesize that since their patient\n      population has had diabetes for less time as compared to adults, the levels of C-peptide\n      should be higher than reported for adults and that a greater proportion of patients in the\n      pediatric population will have detectable C-peptide levels as compared to adults.',
